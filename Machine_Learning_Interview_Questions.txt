1. Why Cognizant? (Followed by cross-questions)
2. Explain the Difference between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.
3. What is Reinforcement Learning?
4. Name some algorithms you are familiar with.
5. SVM vs Linear Regression â€“ What's the difference?
6. How would you react if offered a support role instead of an SDE role? (Follow-up discussions)
7. Explain directories in Python.
8. Write a code using threads, semaphores, and synchronized keywords in Java.
9. What is a SELF JOIN in SQL?
10. Print a given pattern.
11. Write a code to take some random words and produce a grammatically correct sentence (rearranging those jumbled words).
For the jumbled word problem, I initially proposed using a HashMap of Vector -> String in C++ since the solution could rely on user memory.
A long discussion followed where I was asked to write the code in Java instead. This led to a debate about C++ vs Java and why companies prefer Java.
12. Are you familiar with the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)?
Task: Find the shortest path between City A and City C in a network of 5 cities.
Follow-up: Solve it using recursion (which I managed to do).
13. What is a knowledge base?
