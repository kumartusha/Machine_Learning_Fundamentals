        <h2>What is Autism?</h2>
        <p>
          Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental condition
          that affects an individual's social interactions, communication, and
          behavior. The symptoms of autism can vary widely from one individual
          to another, but early diagnosis can significantly improve outcomes for
          those affected.

      <!-- Symptoms of Autism -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Symptoms of Autism</h2>
        <p>
          Autism can manifest in different ways and to varying degrees. Some
          common symptoms include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Difficulty with communication and social interactions.</li>
          <li>Repetitive behaviors, such as hand-flapping or rocking.</li>
          <li>Strong preferences for routine and resistance to change.</li>
          <li>
            Hyper-sensitivity or hypo-sensitivity to sensory input, such as
            sounds, textures, or light.
          </li>
          <li>
            Challenges with understanding social cues or expressing emotions.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Diagnosis of Autism -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>How is Autism Diagnosed?</h2>
        <p>
          Autism is usually diagnosed through a combination of developmental
          history, behavioral evaluations, and observations. There is no single
          medical test to diagnose autism, so a multidisciplinary team of
          doctors, psychologists, and other specialists work together to provide
          a comprehensive assessment. Some diagnostic methods include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Developmental screening tests to check for developmental delays.
          </li>
          <li>
            Behavioral assessments where professionals observe and document the
            child's behavior in different settings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Parental questionnaires to gather information on the child's
            behavior at home and in social situations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Genetic testing and other medical tests to rule out other conditions
            or diagnose co-occurring conditions.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Treatment for Autism -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Treatment for Autism</h2>
        <p>
          While there is no cure for autism, early interventions can help
          individuals with autism develop necessary skills and lead fulfilling
          lives. Treatment methods can vary and may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Behavioral therapy to teach new skills and modify challenging
            behaviors.
          </li>
          <li>Speech and language therapy to improve communication skills.</li>
          <li>
            Occupational therapy to help with daily living skills and sensory
            challenges.
          </li>
          <li>Social skills training to enhance interaction with peers.</li>
          <li>
            Medications to manage co-occurring conditions such as anxiety,
            depression, or hyperactivity.
