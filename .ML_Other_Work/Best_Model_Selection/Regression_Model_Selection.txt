For regression tasks, similar to classification, the choice of the model depends on the dataset, task complexity, and other factors like interpretability and computational efficiency. Here’s a comparison of common regression models:

1. Linear Regression:
Use case: Predicting a continuous target variable with a linear relationship.
Performance: Works well if the relationship between the features and the target is approximately linear.
Pros: Simple, interpretable, fast to train.
Cons: Performs poorly if the data has non-linear relationships or outliers.
2. Ridge and Lasso Regression (Regularized Linear Models):
Use case: For linear regression with regularization.
Performance: Performs well when there’s multicollinearity or when you want to prevent overfitting.
Ridge: Adds L2 penalty (squares of the coefficients).
Lasso: Adds L1 penalty (absolute values of coefficients).
Pros: Helps in feature selection (Lasso), handles multicollinearity (Ridge).
Cons: Still assumes a linear relationship.
3. Decision Trees for Regression:
Use case: Non-linear regression tasks with complex relationships.
Performance: Handles non-linearity well.
Pros: Can model complex relationships, no need for feature scaling.
Cons: Prone to overfitting, less stable, difficult to interpret in larger trees.
4. Random Forest Regression:
Use case: Non-linear regression tasks with a large number of features.
Performance: Tends to outperform decision trees by averaging predictions of multiple trees, reducing overfitting.
Pros: Robust, handles large datasets, not prone to overfitting.
Cons: Computationally expensive, hard to interpret.
5. Support Vector Regression (SVR):
Use case: Suitable for high-dimensional and complex regression problems.
Performance: Performs well when there is a non-linear relationship, especially with high-dimensional data.
Pros: Works well with high-dimensional spaces, effective for non-linear regression.
Cons: Requires tuning of hyperparameters, computationally expensive for large datasets.
6. K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN):
Use case: Predicting a continuous variable based on similar data points.
Performance: Non-parametric, works well for small datasets or when relationships are non-linear.
Pros: Simple, easy to implement.
Cons: Computationally expensive, especially with large datasets, and sensitive to the choice of the distance metric.
7. Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost):
Use case: Non-linear regression tasks, works well with large datasets and complex relationships.
Performance: Often gives state-of-the-art performance on many regression tasks.
Pros: High performance, handles missing data well, flexible.
Cons: Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters, computationally expensive.
8. Neural Networks (MLP for Regression):
Use case: Complex regression tasks where patterns are too difficult for traditional models to capture.
Performance: Excellent with large datasets and highly complex relationships.
Pros: Very flexible, can learn non-linear relationships.
Cons: Requires a large amount of data, computationally expensive, hard to interpret.
How to Choose the Best Model for Regression:
Dataset Size:

For small datasets, simple models like Linear Regression or Decision Trees might work better.
For large datasets, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks might be more appropriate.
Linear vs Non-linear:

If the relationship between features and target is linear, Linear Regression, Ridge, or Lasso will perform well.
If the relationship is non-linear, models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVR, or Gradient Boosting are better choices.
Feature Engineering:

Models like Linear Regression assume that features have a linear relationship with the target.
Tree-based methods (like Random Forests) can handle more complex, non-linear relationships without needing complex feature engineering.
Computational Resources:

Simple models like Linear Regression are computationally cheap and fast.
Ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and Neural Networks can be computationally expensive and may require more time to tune and train.
Interpretability:

If interpretability is important, simpler models like Linear Regression or Decision Trees are easier to explain.
Ensemble models and Neural Networks are harder to interpret but can provide better performance.
